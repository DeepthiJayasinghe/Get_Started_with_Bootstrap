# Get_Started_with_Bootstrap

I've analyzed your Bootstrap project. This is a landing page for a fullstack development bootcamp with a clean, responsive layout using Bootstrap 5.3.8. Here's what I found:

## Structure Overview

**Header Section:**
- Full viewport height hero with centered content
- Main headline with laptop icon
- Two CTA buttons (Get started/Learn more)

**Main Content:**
1. "How it works" section with three feature cards
2. FAQ section with Bootstrap accordion

**Footer:**
- Simple copyright notice with primary background

## Code Quality Issues

**HTML Problems:**
1. Typo in card text: "viedos" should be "videos"
2. Typo in accordion: "othe programs" should be "other programs"
3. Typo in accordion: "approch" should be "approach"

**Responsive Design:**
The layout uses Bootstrap's grid system effectively:
- Cards: `col-12 col-md-4 col-lg-3` (stacks on mobile, 3 across on tablet, with more spacing on desktop)
- FAQ: `col-8` (centered, but might be too wide on mobile - should probably be `col-12 col-md-8`)

**Custom CSS:**
Your `app.css` extends Bootstrap's margin utilities (mb-6 through mb-12), which is useful but creates an inconsistency with Bootstrap's standard scale.

Your Bootstrap project doesn't need "installation" in the traditional sense - it's a static website that runs directly in a web browser. Here's how to use it:
To Run It Locally:

Make sure you have all the files:

index.html
app.css
images/ folder with the three image files mentioned in the HTML


Open the HTML file:

Simply double-click index.html, or
Right-click → "Open with" → choose your web browser



That's it. The page will load in your browser.
Why No Installation Needed:
Your project uses CDN links for Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons:
html<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" ...>
This means Bootstrap loads from the internet, so you don't need to install anything locally.
